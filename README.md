## DebateIt

DebateIt (name pending) is a website that allows random strangers from opposing political backgrounds to talk anonymously about a shared topic.
There are no logins, no profiles, just choose your political alignment, choose a current event topic, and hit connect. You can end that chat with the stranger at anytime.

### How to run

in the root folder just run
```
npm start
```
The script will run `npm install` and `npm start` in both the backend and frontend folders simultaneously
